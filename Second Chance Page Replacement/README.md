# Second Chance Page Replacement Algorithm

In this algorithm, the targeted pages for removal are considered in a round robin manner, and page that has been accessed between consecutive considerations will not be replaced. The page replaced is the one that, when considered in a round robin matter, has not been accessed since its last consideration. It can be implemented by adding a “second chance” bit to each memory frame-every time the frame is considered, this bit is set to 1, which gives the page a second chance, as when we consider the candidate page for replacement, we replace the first one with this bit set to 0. Thus, a page with the “second chance” bit set to 1 is never replaced during the first consideration and will only be replaced if all the other pages deserve a second chance too! (GeekforGeeks)
